- `data_utils.py`: Provides functions for loading, splitting, and preprocessing contract data.
- `explainability.py`: Implements explanations for model predictions using LIME or SHAP.
- `main.py`: The main script to train, evaluate, and explain machine learning models on contract data.
- `models.py`: Defines different models for contract analysis, including BiLSTM_ResNet, BERT_Model, and EnsembleModel.
- `training.py`: Contains functions for training and fine-tuning machine learning models.
